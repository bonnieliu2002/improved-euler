# improved-euler
some code I wrote to find an approximation for a function at x given an initial value using the improved Euler's method for my differential equations course

To use this calculator, please edit the following:
1) The function f(x,y) is the first-order differential equation.
2) Under the main function, y is the initial value at x.
3) Under the main function, xn is the final value for which y is needed.
4) Under the main function, h is the step size.

Here's a link to a video explaining the improved Euler's method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5ObpYPADPQ
